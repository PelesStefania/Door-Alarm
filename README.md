# Door-Alarm

This was a project for the IoT course.
It is a door alarm system that notifies the user when the door has been opened by force, without using an authorized card.

It uses an RFID reader to detect authorized cards.
A reed switch detects the state of the door.
If the door is opened without a valid card, the alarm is triggered.
If a valid card is used, the system unlocks the door.

For this project, I used: Arduino UNO, MFRC522 RFID reader, magnetic door sensor, buzzer, LEDs, and C++.
